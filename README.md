# RPS - your final enemy for `Rock, Paper, Scissors`

> ## “The world is so unpredictable. Things happen suddenly, unexpectedly. We want to feel we are in control of our own existence. In some ways we are, in some ways we're not. We are ruled by the forces of chance and coincidence.” - Paul Auster

`RPS` is your competition whenever you're up for a battle of `Rock, Paper, Scissors`. Challenge yourself and give it a try. Easy to implement, and slightly addictive. Note that I used my own [library](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/tree/main/libft) for [printf](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/libft/ft_printf.c), [strlen](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/libft/ft_strlen.c) and [atoi](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/libft/ft_atoi.c).

1. `Git clone` the current repository.
      
       git clone https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps.git
2. Go into the directory.
      
       cd PRIVATE_rps
2. Run the following command to `make` an archive, `compile` and `execute` RPS.
      
       make -s
# Opportunities presented by RPS
- You may easily adjust the maximal amount of rounds you are allowed to play by modifying the global variable `MAX_AMOUT`in [rock_paper_scissors.h](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors.h).
