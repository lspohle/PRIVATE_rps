# RPS - your final enemy for `Rock, Paper, Scissors`

> ## “The world is so unpredictable. Things happen suddenly, unexpectedly. We want to feel we are in control of our own existence. In some ways we are, in some ways we're not. We are ruled by the forces of chance and coincidence.” - Paul Auster

`RPS` is your competition whenever you're up for a battle of `Rock, Paper, Scissors`. Challenge yourself and give it a try. Easy to implement, and slightly addictive. Note that I used my own [library](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/tree/main/libft) for [printf](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/libft/ft_printf.c), [strlen](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/libft/ft_strlen.c) and [atoi](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/libft/ft_atoi.c).

1. `Git clone` the current repository.
      
       git clone https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps.git
2. Go into the directory, and run the following command to `make` an archive, `compile` and `execute` RPS.
      
       make -s
# Opportunities presented by RPS
- You may easily adjust the maximal amount of rounds you are allowed to play by modifying the global variable `MAX_AMOUT`in [rock_paper_scissors.h](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors.h).
- RPS is easy to implement, and it should work on various operating systems (macOS and Ubuntu, for example). Don't worry about warnings that might be thrown by the compiler if you're using a different operating system than macOS. It varies form operating system to operating system. Keep in mind that you need `gcc`- a compiler for C - and `git` - an open source distributed version control system. They are pre-installed on macOS and Linux (not on Windows, for example).
